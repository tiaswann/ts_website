## Better Late Studios: a playful, welcoming space for creative experimentation.

Itâ€™s never too late to start something new, try something different, or create things just for the fun of it.

Our studio in central Auckland was a year-long prototype of a place for artists of all levels to gather, collaborate, and share ideas without pressure. It was also the culmination of a decades-long pipe dream to start an artist-run-space from scratch. Along the way, we held numerous workshops, hosted craft markets, and supported local artists by providing accessible studio space in a cost-of-living crisis. 

Better Late was about giving ourselves permission to try, to make mistakes, and to make Auckland a better place to be, even if just for a while. 

Better late than never, right?
